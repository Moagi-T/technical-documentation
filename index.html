                <p><span class="bold">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</span> is a styling language used to define the
                    visual
                    appearance of documents written in HTML or XML (including variations like SVG, MathML, or XHTML). It
                    controls
                    how elements are displayed across different media, such as screens, print, or even speech.
                </p>
                <p>CSS is one of the fundamental languages of the open web and is standardized across all major web
                    browsers
                    based on W3C guidelines. In the past, different parts of the CSS specification were developed
                    together, which
                    made it possible to label them as versions—like CSS1, CSS2.1, or CSS3. However, there won’t be a
                    CSS4. Today,
                    everything is simply referred to as "CSS," with individual modules updated and versioned separately.

            <div class="section-indent">
                <p>A <span class="bold">CSS selector</span> is the starting part of a CSS rule. It defines a pattern
                    that tells
                    the browser which HTML elements to target so the styles specified in the rule can be applied to
                    them.</p>
                <p>Selectors, whether used in CSS or JavaScript, enable targeting HTML elements based on their type,
                    attributes,
                    current states, and even position in the DOM. Combinators allow you to be more precise when
                    selecting elements
                    by enabling selecting elements based on their relationship to other elements.</p>
                <pre><code><span class="element">.elementID</span> {
  <span class="property">color:</span> <span class="property-value">black</span>;
} 
          </code></pre>
                <h3>Selector Types</h3>
                <p>A <span class="bold">type selector</span> targets all elements with a specific tag name.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, <span class="bold">div</span> selects every element, while <span
                            class="bold">input</span>
                        targets all input elements.</li>
                    <li>The <span class="bold">universal selector</span>, written as an asterisk (*), is a special type
                        of
                        selector that matches all elements.</li>
                    <li>The <span class="bold">class selector</span> targets elements with a specific class attribute,
                        using a
                        period (.) before the class name—for example, .index will select any element with class="index".
                    </li>
                    <li>The <span class="bold">ID selector</span> targets elements by their id attribute, using a hash
                        symbol (#)
                        before the ID—like #toc, which selects the element with id="toc".</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While class and id are both global attributes, only one element in a document should have a specific
                    ID.
                    However, if multiple elements share the same ID, the ID selector will still match all of them.</p>
                <p>When creating compound selectors, the type or universal selector should come before the class or ID
                    selector.
                    For instance, div.index targets elements with the class index.</p>

                <h1>CSS Box Model</h1>
            </header>
            <div class="section-indent">
                <p>In CSS, every element is surrounded by a box, and understanding how these boxes work is essential for
                    building more complex layouts or aligning elements effectively.</p>
                <p>The <span class="bold">CSS box model</span>, which primarily applies to block-level elements, defines
                    how the
                    content, padding, border, and margin combine to form the visible box on a webpage. Inline elements
                    follow only
                    parts of this model. To make things a bit more intricate, CSS also offers two different box models:
                    the
                    standard model and an alternate one.</p>
                <h3>Box composition</h3>
                <p>These components make up a box:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Content box:</span> This is where your actual content appears. You control
                        its size
                        using properties like <span class="highlight">width</span> and <span>height</span>.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Padding box:</span> The padding sits around the content as white space; size
                        it using
                        <span class="highlight">padding</span> and related properties.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Border box:</span> The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it
                        using
                        <span class="highlight">border</span> and related properties.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Margin box:</span> The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content,
                        padding,
                        and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using
                        <span class="highlight">margin</span> and related properties.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Below is an illustration of the layers forming a box:</p>

                <div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="layout">
            <header>
                <h1>Layout</h1>
            </header>
            <div class="section-indent">
                <p><span class="bold">CSS layout</span> techniques give us the ability to position elements on a web
                    page based
                    on several factors: their default placement in the normal document flow, their relationship to
                    surrounding
                    elements, their parent container, and the overall browser window or viewport.</p>
                <p>The <span class="bold">three types</span> of layouts in CSS are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="bold">Flow</span> - Flow layout or normal flow</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Flex</span> - Flexible box layout or flexbox</li>
                    <li><span class="bold">Grid</span> - Grid layout</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>CSS Flow Layout</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">Normal Flow</span> or <span class="bold">Flow Layout</span>, is the way that block
                    and
                    inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout. The flow is
                    essentially a
                    set of things that are all working together and know about each other in your layout. Once something
                    is taken
                    out of flow it works independently.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Inline elements</span> will display themselves in the inline direction. This
                    means, in the
                    direction words are displayed in a sentence according to the Writing Mode of the document.
                    <span class="bold">Block elements</span> display one after the other, as paragraphs do in the
                    Writing Mode of
                    that document. To put it in more simpler terms, inline elements display one after the other,
                    starting on the
                    left, and block elements start at the top and move down the page.
                </p>
                <pre><code><span class="element">.inline-element</span> {
  <span class="property">display:</span> <span class="property-value">inline</span>;
}

<span class="element">.block-element</span> {
  <span class="property">display:</span> <span class="property-value">block</span>;
}</code></pre>
                <p>Once an element is displayed on a page inside the normal flow, it can be further adjusted with the
                    <span class="highlight">position</span> property. The <span class="bold">position property</span>
                    allows you
                    to precisely control the placement of boxes inside other boxes. static positioning is the default in
                    normal
                    flow, but you can cause elements to be laid out differently using other values, for example, fixing
                    them to
                    the top of the browser viewport using <span class="highlight">position: fixed.</span>
                </p>
                <p>The possible values for the position property include:</p>
                <pre><code><span class="element">.element</span> {
  <span class="property">position:</span> <span class="property-value">static</span>;
  <span class="property">position:</span> <span class="property-value">relative</span>;
  <span class="property">position:</span> <span class="property-value">absolute</span>;
  <span class="property">position:</span> <span class="property-value">fixed</span>;
  <span class="property">position:</span> <span class="property-value">sticky</span>;
}</code></pre>
                <p>Another CSS property that allows us to further position an element in the normal flow is the
                    <span class="bold">float property</span>. Before CSS Flexbox and Grid, the float property was used
                    to allow
                    block elements to be positioned next to each other on the same line. Now, Flexbox and Grid are used
                    for this
                    and the use cases for the float property are now more limited.
                </p>
                <h3>CSS Flexbox Layout</h3>
                <p>The <span class="bold">CSS flexible box layout</span> allows us to specify an element as a container
                    element.
                    This container element is known as a <span class="highlight">flex container</span>. When a flex
                    container is
                    created, the direct children of the container are then represented using boxes that have flexible
                    sizes. By
                    saying flexible sizes, we mean that the boxes can either grow or shrink in size to fit inside their
                    parent
                    element, the flex container.</p>
                <p>To configure a flexbox layout, we apply CSS flex and alignment properties to the container and the
                    direct
                    children of the container.</p>
                <p>An example of some CSS Flexbox properties:</p>
                <pre><code><span class="element">.container</span> {
  <span class="property">display</span>: <span class="property-value">flex</span>;
  <span class="property">flex-direction</span>: <span class="property-value">row</span>;
  <span class="property">flex-wrap</span>: <span class="property-value">wrap</span>;
}</code></pre>
                <h3>CSS Grid Layout</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">CSS grid layout</span> introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS. Grids can
                    be used
                    to lay out major page areas or small user interface elements. A <span class="highlight">grid</span>
                    is a set
                    of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining rows and columns. Elements can be placed onto
                    the grid
                    within these column and row lines. </p>
                <p>These are the general steps taken to define a grid layout:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Define a container element.</li>
                    <li>Apply display: grid to the container.</li>
                    <li>Define grid columns and rows.</li>
                    <li>Place grid items.</li>
                    <li>Customize grid items (optional).</li>
                    <li>Add gaps between grid items (optional).</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="styling_text">
            <header>
                <h1>Styling Text</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Text inside an element starts at the top left of the content area (or top right for right-to-left
                languages)
                and flows across the line until it reaches the end. Then it moves down to the next line and continues.
                This
                keeps repeating until all the text fits. It behaves like a row of inline elements—only breaking onto a
                new line
                when it runs out of space or when you add a line break with something like <br>.</p>
            <p>The CSS properties used to <span class="bold">style text</span> generally fall into two categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Font styles:</span> These control how the text looks—like which font is used, how
                    big it
                    is, and whether it’s <span class="highlight">bold</span> or <span class="highlight">italic</span>.
                </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Text layout styles:</span> These adjust how the text is spaced and
                    positioned—like
                    <span class="highlight">line spacing</span>, <span class="highlight">letter spacing</span>, and
                    <span class="highlight">text alignment</span> inside its box.

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here are some examples of style based properties:</p>
            <pre><code><span class="element">p</span> {
  <span class="property">color:</span> <span class="property-value">red</span>;
  <span class="property">font-family:</span> <span class="property-value">Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif</span>;
  <span class="property">font-size:</span> <span class="property-value">10px</span>;
  <span class="property">text-transform:</span> <span class="property-value">capitalize</span>;
  <span class="property">font-weight:</span> <span class="property-value">bold</span>;
  <span class="property">text-shadow:</span> <span class="property-value">4px 4px 5px red</span>;
  <span class="property">text-align:</span> <span class="property-value">center</span>;
  <span class="property">line-height:</span> <span class="property-value">1.6</span>;
}</code></pre>
            <p>These are just a few examples, there are many more properties that can be used to style text.</p>

            <header>
                <h1>Transitions and Effects</h1>
            </header>
            <p>You can regulate how quickly style changes occur with <span class="bold">CSS transitions</span>. You can
                make
                those changes gradually over time rather than all at once. For instance, when you change the color of an
                element
                from white to black, it typically changes immediately. However, CSS transitions allow the color to fade
                smoothly
                and according to a customizable speed pattern. An implicit transition occurs when an animation simply
                moves from
                one state to another, such as from beginning to end, with the browser automatically filling in the gaps.
            </p>
            <p>CSS transitions let you decide which properties to <span class="bold">animate</span> (by listing them
                explicitly), when the animation will start (by setting a <span class="highlight">delay</span>), how long
                the
                transition will last (by setting a <span class="highlight">duration</span>), and how the transition will
                run (by
                defining an <span class="highlight">easing function</span>, e.g., linearly or quick at the beginning,
                slow at
                the end).</p>
            <p>CSS Transitions are accessed using the <span class="highlight">transitions property</span>. This is the
                best
                way to configure transitions, as it makes it easier to avoid out of sync parameters, which can be very
                frustrating to have to spend lots of time debugging in CSS.</p>
            <p>Some examples of the usage of the transitions property:</p>
            <pre><code><span class="element">div</span> {
  <span class="property">transition:</span> <span class="property-value">'property' 'duration' 'timing-function' 'delay'</span>;
  <span class="property">transition-property:</span> <span class="property-value">width</span>;
  <span class="property">transition-duration:</span> <span class="property-value">6s</span>;
  <span class="property">transition-delay:</span> <span class="property-value">1s</span>;
}

                <h1>Responsive Design</h1>
            </header>
            <p><span class="bold">Responsive web design (RWD)</span> is a web design approach to make web pages render
                well on
                all screen sizes and resolutions while ensuring good usability. It is the way to design for a
                multi-device web.
            </p>
            <p>HTML is fundamentally responsive, or fluid. If you create a web page containing only HTML, with no CSS,
                and
                resize the window, the browser will automatically reflow the text to fit the viewport. While the default
                responsive behavior may sound like no solution is needed, long lines of text displayed full screen on a
                wide
                monitor can be difficult to read. If wide screen line length is reduced with CSS, such as by creating
                columns or
                adding significant padding, the site may look squashed for the user who narrows their browser window or
                opens
                the site on a mobile device.</p>
            <h3>Media Queries</h3>
            <p>Media queries allow us to run a series of tests (for example, whether the user's screen is greater than a
                certain width or resolution) and apply CSS selectively to style the page appropriately for the user's
                needs.

                For example, the following media query tests to see if the current web page is being displayed as screen
                media
                (therefore not a printed document) and the viewport is at least 80rem wide. The CSS for the
                <span class="highlight">.container</span> selector will only be applied if these two things are true.
            </p>
            <pre><code><span class="element">@media screen and</span> (<span class="element">min-width:</span> <span class="property-value">80rem</span>) {
  <span class="property">.container</span> {
    <span class="property">margin:</span> <span class="property-value">1em 2em</span>;
  }
