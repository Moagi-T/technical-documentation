# CSS Technical Documentation Page

This project is a **Technical Documentation Page** created as part of the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

The CSS Technical Documentation Page provides a simple, responsive layout for presenting structured technical content â€” in this case, information about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It simulates the look and function of real developer documentation.

The project demonstrates:
- Responsive layout with a fixed sidebar navigation
- Use of semantic HTML elements
- Clean, readable typography
- Scrollable main content sections with anchor linking
